# DockerProject By Adarsh Thakur
Docker project to create and deploy a website using Wordpress and Mysql using Docker

For this you require docker installed in your OS 
Install Wordpress and Mysql image from the docker pull cmd
After that just run this Docker-compose file that i have provided and within seconds your webserver will start and you can create your very own site 

I have attached some images in order for your reference

This project has been done under the mentorship of World Record Holder Mr.Vimal Daga 
Thank You sir!

For you to see the website.jpg file you require a big screen as it is not compatible with snall screens
